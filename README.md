# RAG-Chatbot

## Project Overview

**RAG-Chatbot** is an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that enhances conversational AI by fusing dense document retrieval with large language models (LLMs) for context-aware, accurate answers. By grounding generative responses in retrieved documents from a knowledge base, it significantly reduces hallucinations and ensures relevance and factual accuracy.

## Backend Architecture

### Framework: FastAPI (Python)

The backend is powered by **FastAPI**, a high-performance Python web framework, chosen for its:

- **Asynchronous capabilities** for concurrent retrieval and generation.
- **Automatic OpenAPI documentation** for ease of integration and testing.
- **Lightweight, production-ready design** suitable for scaling.

---

### Authentication & Security

- **User Authentication** using secure JWT tokens for protected routes.
- **Email Verification** via tokenized email links sent on signup.
- **Session Management**  to support persistent, secure user-specific conversation history.
- Helps prevent abuse, enables user-specific features, and supports secure multi-user environments.

---

### Retrieval Pipeline

1. **Embedding Generation**  
   - Uses transformer-based models (e.g., Qwen or SentenceTransformers) to convert both documents and queries into dense embeddings.

2. **Vector Store: FAISS**  
   - Embeddings are stored in a vector index that supports fast similarity search.
   - Text is preprocessed and chunked intelligently for optimal retrieval accuracy.

3. **Reranking Layer**  
   - Retrieved candidates are passed through a **reranker model** to prioritize the most semantically relevant passages.
   - Improves retrieval quality and relevance beyond basic cosine similarity.

---

###  Generative Model Integration

- Retrieved and reranked documents are injected as context into an LLM (e.g., **Mistral**, **Qwen**, or OpenAI models).
- RAG orchestration is handled via **LangChain**, enabling modular chaining of retrieval, reranking, and generation steps.
- Supports **local inference via LM Studio** or API-based deployment for flexibility.

---

##  API Design

- RESTful API endpoints to:
  - Accept user queries and return grounded responses.
  - Handle user login/signup with secure token-based auth.
  - Maintain session-based chat history.
- Built with **asynchronous processing** to reduce latency.
- Well-structured error handling for robust user experience.

## Key Features

### 1.Smart Retrieval
- Semantic based chunking for ingestion of texts
- Embedding-based semantic search far beyond keyword matching.
- Reranking improves top-k relevance.

### 2.Contextual Generation

- Grounded answers based on retrieved documents.
- Reduces hallucinations while supporting multi-turn, contextual chat.
- Supports both streaming and memory integration.

### 3.Modular & Extensible Design

- Plug-and-play architecture for:
  - Embedding models
  - Vector databases
  - Rerankers
  - LLMs
 - Ready for CLI, web app, or third-party chat tool integration.

## Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Dialogue Memory**: Implement vector-based long-term memory modules.
- **Metrics & Monitoring**: Add Prometheus/Grafana for usage and performance analytics.
